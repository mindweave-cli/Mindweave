/**
 * messageQueue.ts — messages typed while Mindweave is working.
 *
 * The queue existed before this file did, as six lines inside App.tsx: push on send,
 * shift on turn end. That is enough to not lose a message and not enough to be a
 * feature. Three things were missing, and all three were things a user would only
 * discover by being burned:
 *
 *  - **No way back out.** Once queued, a message was going to be sent. Pressing ↑
 *    looked like editing it — the text appeared, because sending had already written
 *    it to history — but the queued copy was untouched. Editing and sending produced
 *    TWO messages: the edit, and the original the user thought they had just replaced.
 *  - **One turn each.** Three queued messages meant three full turns, each re-sending
 *    the whole conversation. The model also answered each in ignorance of the next,
 *    which is the wrong reading of someone typing three things in a row.
 *  - **Unbounded on screen.** The queue renders in the footer, and the footer is not
 *    height-bounded. Enough queued lines make the frame taller than the terminal,
 *    which corrupts the whole screen rather than clipping (see App's frameHeight
 *    note). Nothing stopped that.
 *
 * The shape: ↑ or Esc pulls the WHOLE queue back into the input as editable text, and
 * the drain batches. Kept deliberately as pure functions
 * over a plain array — the queue is small, always local to one App, and every rule in
 * it is worth a test.
 *
 * ## Two drains, because there are two moments
 *
 * A fourth thing was missing for longer than the other three: the queue only ever
 * emptied when the turn was completely over. A message typed twenty seconds into a four
 * minute task was not read for four minutes, and by then it was a comment on finished
 * work rather than a correction to work in progress. Waiting is the wrong default for
 * the only kind of message anyone types while watching an agent run.
 *
 * So `takeSteerable` hands what it can to the turn that is ALREADY RUNNING, at its next
 * step boundary, and `drain` keeps the turn-boundary behaviour for what cannot be handed
 * over — commands, and anything typed in the gap before the turn ended. The rules for
 * which is which are on each function.

 * WHEN a queued message may be delivered. Not how important it is.
 *
 *  - `next`  — into the running turn, at its next step boundary. Ordinary prose typed
 *              while Mindweave works: it is about the work, so it goes to the work.
 *  - `now`   — as its own turn, as soon as the current one is dead. Set when the user
 *              has already pressed Esc: they stopped the turn, so nothing they type
 *              after that may be fed back into it.
 *  - `later` — as its own turn, once the current one ends by itself. Slash commands,
 *              which are things to DO and need the turn to be over before they can be
 *              done.
 *
 * There is deliberately no reordering between them. One person types at one keyboard,
 * in one order, and a queue that let a later message overtake an earlier one would run
 * them in an order nobody typed. Priority here answers "may this go into the running
 * turn", never "which of these goes first".

/**
 * What may be delivered INTO a turn that is already running, and what stays queued.
 *
 * A message typed while Mindweave is working is almost always about the work in
 * progress. Held until the turn ends, it arrives after the thing it was about is
 * finished, which is the wrong moment for every message worth typing — a correction
 * lands too late to correct anything. So prose is handed to the running turn at its next
 * step boundary and the model changes course.
 *
 * Only `next` is eligible, and only the unbroken run of it at the FRONT.
 *
 * A slash command (`later`) is not something to say to the model, it is something to DO,
 * and doing it needs the turn to be over: `/model` mid-flight would change models
 * between two calls of one conversation.
 *
 * A message typed after Esc (`now`) is not eligible either, and that one is easy to get
 * wrong. The user stopped the turn; feeding them back into it would carry out their
 * correction inside the very turn they cancelled.
 *
 * Stopping at the FIRST ineligible entry is what keeps the order honest. Someone who
 * types a message, then `/model`, then another message meant the last one to come after
 * the switch; steering it would run the three in an order they were never typed in.

 * What to send next as its OWN turn, and what stays queued.
 *
 * The turn-boundary drain. What reaches it is what could not be steered: slash commands,
 * and anything typed in the gap between the last step boundary and the turn ending.
 *
 * Consecutive plain messages go out TOGETHER, as one turn. Someone who types three
 * sentences while waiting meant them as one thought, and answering the first without
 * having read the third is how you get an answer that is immediately obsolete. It is
 * also the cheaper read: one turn re-sends the conversation once instead of three
 * times.
 *
 * A slash command always goes alone. It is not something to say to the model, it is
 * something to DO — merging `/model` into the prose around it would send the literal
 * word to the model instead of switching anything.
 *
 * Messages batch only with others of the SAME priority, which in practice means only
 * `next` with `next`. A message typed after Esc is put to the model differently — it
 * says the user stopped the work to send it — and merging one into the prose around it
 * would apply that to text it was not true of.
