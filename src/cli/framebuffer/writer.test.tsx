/**
 * writer.test.tsx — real Ink output through the framebuffer, end to end.
 *
 * `paint.test.ts` proves the diff is correct for grids built by hand. This proves it
 * against what INK ACTUALLY EMITS, which is the part no amount of unit testing can
 * stand in for: real chalk colour codes, real wrapping, real erase prefixes, real
 * frame-to-frame churn.
 *
 * The shape of every test is the same comparison, and it is the only one that
 * matters:
 *
 *     render the component to a plain stdout           -> the screen Ink INTENDED
 *     render the same component through the framebuffer -> the screen a terminal ENDS UP WITH
 *     assert they are cell-for-cell identical
 *
 * If those ever diverge, the framebuffer is lying about the screen — which is the one
 * failure mode that would make it worse than the full rewrite it replaces.
