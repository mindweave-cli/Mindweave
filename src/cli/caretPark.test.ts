/**
 * caretPark.test.ts — the caret takes no column, and its position comes from LAYOUT.
 *
 * Every caret the app draws has to live in a cell, because a terminal grid has no room
 * between two of them. Standing ON a character hides it for half of each blink; taking a
 * column of its own opens a gap between the characters it sits between. So nothing is
 * drawn: the terminal's own cursor is parked at the right cell after each frame.
 *
 * WHERE it goes is the part that went wrong twice. The first version searched the PAINTED
 * screen for the caret's row text, which fails the moment the paint and the text disagree
 * — a row ending in a space is painted against padding spaces, a long row is painted
 * truncated — and a failed search dropped the cursor entirely. Typing a space made the
 * caret vanish until the next keystroke.
 *
 * It reads the layout now, which already knows the answer and cannot disagree with itself.
