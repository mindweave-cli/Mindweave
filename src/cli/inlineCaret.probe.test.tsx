/**
 * inlineCaret.probe.test.tsx — the inline shell's caret is the REAL terminal cursor.
 *
 * Both shells put the terminal's own cursor on the caret cell; they differ only in who
 * does the arithmetic. Fullscreen owns the screen and parks it itself (caretPark.ts).
 * Inline owns nothing, but Ink does, and `useCursor` is its API for exactly this: give it
 * a position relative to the live output and it appends the move and the show to its own
 * frame.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole file. The alternative — and what every inline terminal
 * app draws when it gives up on this — is a block of inverse text standing in for a
 * cursor. It takes a column or hides a character, it does not blink, and it looks nothing
 * like the caret in the rest of the terminal. Getting the real one is the difference, and
 * the only place it can be observed is the bytes.
