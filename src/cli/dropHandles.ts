/**
 * dropHandles.ts — short names for files dropped into the input.
 *
 * A terminal delivers a dragged file as its full path, so dropping one screenshot puts
 * something like `"C:\Users\me\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2026-09-06 091037.png"`
 * into the middle of the line you are writing. It wraps, it buries the sentence around
 * it, and editing near it means stepping over sixty characters you did not type.
 *
 * So the path is swapped for a handle the moment it lands: `mwimg1`, `mwfile2`. The
 * handle is what you see and edit; the real path is kept here and handed back at send
 * time, so nothing downstream has to know this happened.
 *
 * The same trade already exists for large pastes, which collapse to a `[Pasted text #1]`
 * chip and expand on send. This is that idea applied to the other thing that arrives in
 * the buffer at a size nobody wants to look at.
