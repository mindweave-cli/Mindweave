/**
 * screenMode.ts — which shell the app is wearing.
 *
 * The same transcript, the same blocks, the same streaming. Two ways of putting them on
 * a terminal, and they are opposites about one thing: who owns the screen.
 *
 * ## fullscreen
 *
 * We do. The alternate screen buffer, every cell ours to paint, the input pinned to the
 * bottom, our own scrolling, our own selection, our own cursor. Nothing leaks into the
 * user's scrollback. The cost is that every one of those is something we have to be good
 * at, and the bill grows with the length of the session: a frame costs what is on screen,
 * and scrolling means rebuilding it.
 *
 * ## inline
 *
 * The terminal does. Finished blocks are printed ONCE, into the terminal's own
 * scrollback, and never touched again; only the live tail is re-rendered. Scrolling is
 * the terminal's scrollbar. Selecting and copying is the terminal's selection. Both are
 * native, instant, and cost us nothing at all — and a frame costs what is happening now
 * rather than what has happened all session, so a four-hour conversation renders exactly
 * as fast as a four-minute one.
 *
 * What is given up is everything that needs the screen back: the pinned prompt scrolls
 * away like a shell prompt, there is no mouse, no click-to-place-caret, no drag-select of
 * our own, and a row that has been printed is final. It also works in places fullscreen
 * cannot — over a poor ssh link, inside a multiplexer that eats mouse reporting, in a
 * terminal with no alternate screen at all.
 *
 * Neither is the "real" one. `/screen` switches, and the choice is remembered for the
 * project, so it is made once rather than at the start of every session.

/**
 * Which shell a session opens in.
 *
 * The env var wins, so a single laggy ssh session can be started inline without changing
 * anything the project keeps. Below it is the saved choice: the shell is a decision about
 * how you want to work, not about one sitting, and having to make it again at the start
 * of every session is the same decision being asked repeatedly. Neither present means
 * fullscreen.

 * the terminal's own wheel, scrollbar and drag-to-select all stop responding — the app
 * is holding them. Fullscreen makes the same trade, but there it is the point: the app
 * owns the screen and does the scrolling and selecting itself. Inline is meant to be the
