 * altScreen.ts — enter/exit the terminal's alternate screen buffer by hand.
 *
 * Ink has an `alternateScreen` render option, but the sequences are owned here instead:
 * they have to be paired with the wheel-reporting teardown and written from signal
 * handlers Ink knows nothing about, so a second owner of the same modes would only
 * create a way for the two to disagree. They are three lines and stable across every
 * VT100-descended terminal.
 *
 * Must always be paired with `exitAltScreen()` before the process actually dies, or the
 * user's shell is left showing a blank alternate-screen buffer. Covers the ways this
 * process ends that still run code: a clean exit, a signal (Ctrl+C, kill, or the
 * terminal window closing), and an uncaught exception — each calls the same idempotent
 * restore.
 *
 * The ways it ends that do NOT run code — a V8 fatal out-of-memory, SIGKILL, a
 * force-quit — cannot be covered from in here at all. That is what
 * `mindweave --reset-terminal` is for; see `terminalRestore.ts`.
