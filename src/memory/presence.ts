/**
 * presence.ts — which files the model can actually still SEE (pure).
 *
 * The read ledger (`ToolContext.reads`) owns a FACT: "this file was read at this
 * mtime/size, and here are the regions the model focused on." That fact is what the
 * edit freshness gate needs, and it stays true no matter what happens to the
 * transcript.
 *
 * "The content of this file is currently visible to the model" is a different kind of
 * claim. It is not a fact about the past; it is a property of the bytes about to be
 * sent, and it changes every time the transcript changes. The moment it is STORED
 * next to the fact, every future transcript mutation has to remember to update it —
 * and the one that forgets ships a model reasoning about a file it can no longer see.
 *
 * So it is derived, never stored. `workingSetFull` already answers it for the volatile
 * working-set block (emitted by the same pass that renders those bytes). This module
 * answers it for the other half: a full `read_file` result still sitting unstubbed in
 * the transcript. Together they are the whole answer, and `read_file`'s two
 * short-circuits consult one each.
 *
 * See BOUNDARY.md, "Records, derivations, and standing knowledge".
