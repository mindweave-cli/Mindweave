/**
 * connection.ts — one MCP server, and what state it is in.
 *
 * The previous implementation had no notion of state: a server was in a map or it was
 * not. That makes three ordinary situations indistinguishable — still starting, failed
 * to start, and waiting on the user to authenticate — so nothing could report anything
 * useful and a dead server stayed dead for the session.
 *
 * So a connection is a small state machine:
 *
 *   pending ──► connected ──► (dies) ──► pending ──► …
 *      │                                    │
 *      ├──► failed          (cap reached) ◄─┘
 *      └──► needs-auth
 *
 * `needs-auth` is deliberately separate from `failed`. A 401 is not a broken server, it
 * is a server waiting on the user, and collapsing the two would make the eventual auth
 * flow look like an outage.
 *
 * Reconnection is capped at 3 consecutive failures, the same number used by the
 * repeat-failure breaker in the engine. Past the cap we STOP and surface the state
 * rather than retrying forever: a server that cannot start will not start on the
 * fourth try, and quietly burning attempts is how a session ends up slow for a reason
 * the user cannot see. `/mcp` can always retry by hand.
