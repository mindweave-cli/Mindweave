/**
 * catalog.ts — turning a server's advertised tools into tools the engine can run.
 *
 * This is the seam that makes MCP invisible to the rest of Mindweave: everything above
 * it sees a `ToolSchema` and a `Tool`, exactly like `read_file` or `run_command`, and
 * never learns that a child process is involved. It is the one piece of the old
 * implementation worth keeping, so it is kept deliberately.
 *
 * The additions are all about COST and TRUST, because a tool catalog is not free:
 *
 *  - NAMESPACING (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`) so two servers cannot collide.
 *  - DESCRIPTION CAPS, because a description goes straight into the prompt on every
 *    uncached turn and a server chooses its own length. Published measurements put a
 *    single MCP tool at 550-1,400 tokens and one popular server's catalog at 17,600.
 *    The cap also happens to truncate an 8KB "ignore your instructions" description,
 *    which is the cheapest poisoning mitigation available.
 *  - DETERMINISTIC ORDER. 2026-07-28 asks servers to return `tools/list` in a stable
 *    order specifically so clients can cache and so prompt-cache prefixes stay intact.
 *    Asking is not guaranteeing, so we sort anyway: an unstable catalog would break the
 *    cached prefix on every single turn.
 *
 * Pure. No I/O, no dispatch — `manager.ts` owns calling.
