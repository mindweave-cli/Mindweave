/**
 * deferred.ts — showing the model a few good tools instead of every tool.
 *
 * Why this exists, stated carefully, because the usual justification is wrong for us:
 * it is NOT about running out of context. DeepSeek V4 stores 1M tokens, so even a
 * 30,000-token catalog is a few percent of the window. The reason is **selection
 * accuracy**. A model choosing among 300 tools chooses worse than one choosing among
 * 40, at any context length, and that degradation does not care how much room is left.
 * The token saving is a real but secondary benefit.
 *
 * The mechanism: past a threshold, MCP tools are held back from the advertised list and
 * the model gets one search tool instead. Searching ACTIVATES the matches, which join
 * the advertised list from the next step onward and stay for the rest of the session.
 *
 * That interacts with the per-turn catalog freeze from Phase 3, and the trade is
 * deliberate: activating a tool changes the `tools` array and therefore costs one
 * prompt-cache invalidation. It is worth it because it happens when the model actually
 * reaches for something, once, rather than paying for the whole catalog on every turn.
 * Activation being sticky is what keeps it to once.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The ranking is the part most likely to need tuning against
 * real behaviour, so it must be adjustable without a live server.
