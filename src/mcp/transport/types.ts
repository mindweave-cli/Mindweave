/**
 * types.ts — the one thing every MCP transport has to be.
 *
 * MCP runs over a local child process (stdio) or over HTTP (Streamable HTTP). Those are
 * genuinely different animals: one is a pipe you own the lifecycle of, the other is a
 * request/response with streaming bodies and no session. Everything above this file
 * should not care which it got, so the difference stops here.
 *
 * Kept to request/notify/close on purpose. MCP's server-to-client traffic used to need
 * more surface, but 2026-07-28 removed `ping`, removed the HTTP GET channel, and moved
 * change notifications onto an explicit `subscriptions/listen` stream — so a transport
 * no longer needs a general inbound-message channel just to stay alive.
