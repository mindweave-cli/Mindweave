/**
 * http.ts — MCP over Streamable HTTP.
 *
 * The remote transport, and the one 2026-07-28 changed most. What it is NOT, any more:
 *
 *  - No session. The `Mcp-Session-Id` header is gone; there is nothing to establish,
 *    echo back, or re-establish on a 404. Each POST stands alone.
 *  - No GET channel. Server-to-client notifications moved to an explicit
 *    `subscriptions/listen` stream, which is a POST like everything else.
 *  - No resumability. SSE event ids and `Last-Event-ID` were removed. A broken stream
 *    LOSES the in-flight request, and the spec says to re-issue it as a new request
 *    with a new id. So we do not try to reconnect mid-request and pretend nothing
 *    happened; we fail it and let the caller decide.
 *
 * What remains is refreshingly plain: POST a JSON-RPC frame, get back either a single
 * JSON body or an SSE stream, and read the response for THIS request off that stream.
 * The server chooses which; the client says it accepts both.
 *
 * HTTP+SSE (the old two-endpoint transport) is deliberately not implemented. It was
 * deprecated in 2025-03-26 and its sunset has already passed.
