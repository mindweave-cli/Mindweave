/**
 * callback.test.ts — the loopback listener, against a real socket.
 *
 * This is the one piece that cannot be faked: it exists to bind a port, so a test that
 * does not bind one proves nothing about it. Every case here makes a real HTTP request to
 * a real listener on 127.0.0.1.
 *
 * The state check is the reason this file is worth its runtime. Anything on the machine
 * can hit a loopback port, so "a request arrived" and "our flow came back" are different
 * claims, and the second one is the only one that may be allowed to produce a token.
