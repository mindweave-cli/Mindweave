/**
 * index.ts — the one door the rest of Mindweave uses to authorize an MCP server.
 *
 * Everything under `oauth/` is a step; this is the sequence. Two entry points, and the
 * split between them is the whole design:
 *
 *  - `authHeaders()` runs on EVERY request and must be silent, fast and never open a
 *    browser. It hands back a token if one is stored, refreshes it first if it has
 *    expired, and returns nothing at all if there is no credential — a request with no
 *    Authorization header is how we learn a server wants one, so failing to produce a
 *    token is a normal outcome rather than an error.
 *  - `authenticate()` runs when a PERSON asked for it, and is the only thing allowed to
 *    open a browser and hold a port. It never runs on its own: a connection that hits a
 *    401 goes to `needs-auth` and STOPS. A background retry that pops a browser window
 *    for a server the user forgot they configured is a worse outcome than a server that
 *    plainly says it needs signing in.
 *
 * An expired refresh is treated as no credential rather than as a failure: refresh tokens
 * are revoked from dashboards all the time, and the right response is to offer signing in
 * again, not to report a broken connection.
