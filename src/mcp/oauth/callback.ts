/**
 * callback.ts — catching the redirect the browser makes after the user approves.
 *
 * The authorization server cannot talk to a terminal, so the flow ends the only way it
 * can for a native app (RFC 8252): we listen on loopback for a moment, hand the browser a
 * `http://localhost:<port>/callback` address to come back to, and read the code off the
 * query string. The listener exists for one request and then stops.
 *
 * THREE THINGS HERE ARE SECURITY, NOT PLUMBING:
 *
 *  - It binds LOOPBACK ONLY, never `0.0.0.0`. The default binds every interface, which on
 *    a laptop on a café network means anyone on that network can reach the port an
 *    authorization code is about to arrive on. Advertising `localhost` while binding the
 *    loopback addresses is not a loosening: the name resolves to the same two places.
 *  - The port is chosen at RANDOM from a range rather than fixed, so nothing else on the
 *    machine can sit on a known port waiting to receive somebody's code.
 *  - `state` is checked before the code is accepted, and a mismatch is a hard failure
 *    rather than a retry, because a request arriving with the wrong state is by
 *    definition not the flow we started.
 *
 * The port range differs on Windows on purpose: 49152-65535 is the dynamic range the OS
 * hands out to everything else, so picking from it there is a collision waiting to happen.
