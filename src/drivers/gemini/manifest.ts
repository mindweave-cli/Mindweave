/**
 * manifest.ts — what Gemini offers, and the numbers that describe it.
 *
 * Loaded even when the user is running a different provider, so it stays plain
 * data and pure functions. The wire code lives in `client.ts`, a thin binding over
 * the shared OpenAI-compatible layer — Google serves Gemini through an
 * OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` surface at
 * `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`, so the same shared
 * layer every other compat provider uses applies here too.
 *
 * The lineup is the Gemini 3 generation only. Every model in it ALWAYS reasons —
 * Google's own docs are explicit that thinking cannot be disabled on Gemini 3 (the
 * "none" effort value that turns it off only works on the older 2.5 line, which is
 * deliberately not offered here).
 *
 * The 2.5 line is not merely old — Google has CLOSED it to new API keys. Adding
 * `gemini-2.5-flash`, `-flash-lite` or `-pro` puts entries in `/model` that answer every
 * request with a 404: "no longer available to new users". The pricing page still lists
 * them, which is exactly what makes this worth writing down: those prices are published
 * for EXISTING users, so finding a model on the price table is not evidence it can be
 * called. Do not re-add them. Every Flash model below already has a free tier, which was
 * the only reason to want 2.5 in the first place. So unlike xAI or OpenAI there is no "Standard,
 * no thinking" rung on this ladder at all; every level here reasons, at a rung
 * `reasoning_effort` accepts (`low`/`medium`/`high` — the shared type's `xhigh`
 * and `max` are not in Gemini's vocabulary and are clamped down).
