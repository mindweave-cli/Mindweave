 * client.ts — the DeepSeek wire layer.
 *
 * DeepSeek's chat API is OpenAI-compatible, so the request shape, SSE framing,
 * fragmented tool-call arguments and the `reasoning_content` channel are all
 * handled by the shared layer in `../openaiCompat/wire.ts`. This file supplies the
 * facts that differ — and DeepSeek has more of those than any other provider on
 * that layer, which is why they are each explained below rather than listed.
 *
 * Historically this file carried its own copy of all that plumbing. It was the
 * first driver, so there was nothing to share with; three more OpenAI-compatible
 * providers later, a second copy of the SSE reader is just a second place for the
 * same bug to be fixed once and missed.

/**
 * DeepSeek's documented sampling settings for agent use.

 * Two facts from their docs, and the second is why this is a function rather than a
 * constant spread into every body:
 *
 *  1. The recommended operating point is `temperature = 1.0` with `top_p = 0.95` for
 *     agentic use (`1.0` otherwise). We were sending NEITHER, so every call ran on
 *     whatever the endpoint's default happened to be — fine until it changes, and
 *     invisible when it does.
 *  2. "Thinking mode does not support the temperature, top_p, presence_penalty, or
 *     frequency_penalty parameters. These parameters will not trigger an error but
 *     will have no effect." So with thinking ON there is nothing to set.
 *
 * Which means this bites exactly where thinking is off: the Standard `/think` level,
 * and every internal buffered call — the session summarizer, the web-page distiller —
 * since `reasoningFields` sends `{ type: "disabled" }` for those. Those are the calls
 * that were silently un-tuned, and they are also the ones whose output feeds straight
 * back into the transcript.
 *
 * Temperature is NOT lowered to shorten output, ever, however tempting that looks for
 * a summarizer: DeepSeek warns that lower temperatures collapse the reasoning trace
 * and degrade the answer, and that length belongs to `max_tokens`. Written down here
 * because it is exactly the "optimisation" a later reader would otherwise try.
