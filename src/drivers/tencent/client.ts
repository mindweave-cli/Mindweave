 * channel are all handled by the shared layer in `../openaiCompat/wire.ts`. This file
 * supplies only the facts that differ.
 *
 * One of those facts is worth reading before changing anything here: thinking is ON by
 * default and must be switched off explicitly. This is the fourth provider in this
 * project with that default; it is a family pattern rather than a coincidence.
