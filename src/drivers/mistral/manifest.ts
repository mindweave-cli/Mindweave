 * manifest.ts — what Mistral offers, and the numbers that describe it.

 * Loaded even when the user is running a different provider, so it stays plain data
 * and pure functions. The wire code lives in `client.ts`, a thin binding over the
 * shared OpenAI-compatible layer.
 *
 * Mistral's model ids carry a DATE SUFFIX rather than a bare version
 * (`mistral-medium-3-5-26-04`), which is unusual enough to note: the ids here are
 * the dated snapshots from Mistral's own model list, not the `-latest` aliases. A
 * snapshot cannot silently change behaviour underneath a saved config, which is the
 * property worth having when the config is sticky per project.
 *
 * The `magistral-*` reasoning models are deliberately absent: they were deprecated,
 * and `magistral-small-latest` now resolves to Mistral Small 4, whose reasoning is
 * reached through `reasoning_effort` instead.
