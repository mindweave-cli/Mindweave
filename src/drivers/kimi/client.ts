 *   - K2.7 Code takes `thinking: {type}` but accepts only `"enabled"`; `"disabled"`
 *     is a rejected request rather than a soft no-op.
 *   - K2.6 and K2.5 take `thinking: {type}` both ways, and default to ENABLED — so
 *     the off switch is sent explicitly, exactly as on Qwen and DeepSeek. Omitting
 *     it would mean every internal call (the summarizer, the page distiller) quietly
 *     paying for reasoning the UI then discards.
 *
 * `normalize` has already made the config legal for the model, so this only renders
 * it. The model is resolved the same way the shared layer resolves it, so the two
 * can never disagree about which model's rules apply.
