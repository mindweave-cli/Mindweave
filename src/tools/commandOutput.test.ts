/**
 * commandOutput.test.ts — the file a command writes into.

 * child dead once nothing is draining it. The tests that matter here are the ones about
 * READING a file back safely: every read is a byte range at an arbitrary offset, and a
 * range boundary lands mid-character as soon as a command prints anything but ASCII.
