/**
 * saveMemory.ts — the model's hands on Mindweave's cross-session memory.
 *
 * When the model learns something durable worth keeping past this conversation —
 * project context to continue from next time, who the user is, how they want work
 * done, a pointer to an external system — it calls `save_memory`. Saving is silent
 * and automatic: memory is non-destructive, and the user asked NOT to be made to
 * choose yes/no for it. The model just records what's worth keeping and tells the
 * user briefly in chat; deciding WHAT to keep (and keeping universal/cross-project
 * facts rare) is the model's judgment, guided by the prompt.
 *
 * This is distinct from `remember_rule` (a standing project directive the tools
 * enforce) and from MINDWEAVE.md (the project's own knowledge file the model maintains
 * in the project root via the file tools).
