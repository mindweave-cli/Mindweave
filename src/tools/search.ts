/**
 * search.ts — the one way to find things: by what is inside files, or by what they
 * are called.
 *
 * These were `grep`, `glob` and `list_dir`. Three tools answering one question —
 * "where is it?" — differing only in where they look: inside files, at their paths, or
 * at a directory as it sits on disk. The model had to pick before it could start, and
 * the common move (find the files, then search them) meant two calls and a decision
 * the arguments already imply.
 *
 * One tool, and the arguments say what is meant:
 *
 *   search({ pattern })          → search file CONTENTS for a regex
 *   search({ files })            → find files whose PATH matches a glob
 *   search({ pattern, files })   → search contents, but only in files matching
 *   search({ path }) / search({})→ LIST that directory (or every root), one level
 *
 * The third line is why merging is worth more than tidiness: it collapses the
 * find-then-search pair into one call, and it was already possible (grep's `glob`
 * argument), just hidden behind having to know both tools. The fourth removes the
 * only remaining no-op call: asking for nothing in particular now means "show me what
 * is here", which is what a model reaching for a listing wanted anyway.
 *
 * All three implementations are untouched and still live in `grep.ts`, `glob.ts` and
 * `listDir.ts`; this only decides which one a call meant. They are genuinely different
 * machines underneath — one reads file contents, one only ever looks at paths, and the
 * listing reports the DISK rather than the searchable tree — and pretending otherwise
 * in the code would be worse than the three tools were.
 *
 * Read-only, and QUIET: it never renders a row. Searching is how the agent finds its
 * way around, not work done to the project, and the user asked for it to stay out of
 * the stream. The model still gets the full result.

    "Find things in the project. Pass `pattern` to search file CONTENTS with a regular " +

    "within files whose path matches — which saves a separate lookup first. Pass " +
    "NEITHER to LIST what is there, one level deep.\n" +
    "CONTENTS (`pattern`): `output_mode` is 'files_with_matches' (default, just paths), " +
    "'content' (matching lines), or 'count'. Avoid lookahead, lookbehind and " +
    "backreferences; the search engine rejects them. Character classes, groups, " +
    "alternation and anchors are all fine. `multiline` lets a pattern cross line breaks, " +
    "which is how you find a construct that is not on one line (a signature and its body, " +
    `an object literal, a JSX block). Output stops after ${GREP_MAX_OUTPUT_LINES} matching ` +
    "lines and tells you the `offset` to pass for the next page — a capped search is " +
    "something to CONTINUE, not a reason to start reading whole files. Use `after` when " +
    "you want what follows a match (a declaration's body) rather than a symmetric window.\n" +
    `PATHS (\`files\`): a glob like \`**/*.ts\` or \`src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\`, matched against ` +
    "each file's path RELATIVE to the root being searched, so a leading slash does not " +
    `work. Results stop after ${GLOB_MAX_RESULTS} paths and say so when they do.\n` +
    "LISTING (neither argument): the immediate contents of `path`, one level, not " +
    "recursive — or of every session root if you give no path. Entries come directories " +
    "first, then alphabetically. A trailing slash means a directory. `(symlink)` marks a " +
    "link, and it still gets the slash when it points at a directory; `(broken symlink)` " +
    "means the target is gone. `(skipped by search)` marks a directory that is really " +
    "there but that the two searches above will not descend into, which is why a file " +
    `inside it can exist and never appear in a search. Listings stop after ${MAX_ENTRIES} ` +
    "entries and say how many were left out.\n" +
    "Searches every session root unless `path` (a file, directory, or root label) is given.\n" +
    "WHAT IS NOT SEARCHED, so an empty result is NOT proof something is absent: anything " +
    "the project's .gitignore excludes (build output, dist, generated code), node_modules " +
    "and .git always, and secrets (.env, keys) plus other coding agents' data, which are " +
    "refused rather than missing. If what you need lives in one of those, read the file " +
    "directly instead of concluding it is not there. LISTING is the exception and the " +
    "reason to reach for it: it reports the DISK, so ignored build output, secrets and " +
    "other agents' folders all appear. Seeing something listed is not a promise you may " +
    "open it — read_file still refuses secrets and asks before another agent's data. " +
    "Treat a listing as evidence of what exists, and let the read decide what you see.\n" +
