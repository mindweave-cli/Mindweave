/**
 * One read-only tool at two levels of specificity: no `id` lists, an `id` reads.
 *
 * These were `list_shells` and `shell_output`. Same manager, same questions ("what is
 * running" then "what did that one say"), and reading was almost always the direct
 * follow-up to listing — so the split cost two advertised schemas and gave the model a
 * routing decision it did not need.
 *
 * `kill_shell` deliberately stays a separate tool. It is the only mutating one of the
 * three, and the plan-mode filter runs on `tool.readOnly` while BUILDING the advertised
 * list — before any arguments exist. Folding a kill into this tool would therefore force
 * a choice between hiding shell inspection from Architect mode and read-only sub-agents,
 * or offering them a way to kill processes. Neither is acceptable, so the merge stops
 * exactly where the read/write line is.

   * every uncached request of every session — including the many that never background
   * anything.
   *
   * The condition is `list()`, which retains FINISHED shells, and not `running()`.
   * That is deliberate and is about the prompt cache rather than about correctness: the
