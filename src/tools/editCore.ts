/**
 * editCore.ts — the pure matching/splice logic shared by the edit tool.
 *
 * One source of truth for HOW a find-and-replace is applied, kept pure (string in,
 * string out — no fs, no EOL handling) so it's unit-tested once and both tools inherit
 * the same guarantees. The tools wrap it with the disk/EOL/approval concerns; deciding
 * WHAT to change stays the model's job.
 *
 * ── Matching is TIERED, and the tiers are deliberately shallow ──────────────────
 *
 * Two failures dominate in practice, and they need opposite treatments:
 *
 *   1. The model's text is right but its INDENTATION drifted (it retyped a block from
 *      memory, or copied out of a context where leading space was normalized). An
 *      exact matcher rejects this, the model retries with the same mistake, and a turn
 *      burns. Tier 2 fixes it: compare line-by-line with each line trimmed.
 *   2. The text genuinely appears more than once. No amount of cleverness resolves
 *      that — only more context or an explicit replace_all does.
 *
 * The temptation is to keep adding ever-looser tiers until something always matches.
 * That is what the widely-copied "many replacers, first hit wins" design does, and it
 * has a known, unfixed failure mode: a loose tier silently matches the WRONG block and
 * corrupts the file, because nothing checks whether a stricter reading was ambiguous.
 * A wrong edit applied confidently is far worse than a refused edit, so this module
 * takes the opposite stance:
 *
 *   - Tiers run strictest-first and STOP at the first tier that finds anything.
 *     A tier that finds 2 matches reports an ambiguity; it never falls through to a
 *     looser tier hoping for a cleaner answer, because "looser" only ever means "more
 *     ways to be wrong".
 *   - Every tier counts matches across the WHOLE text before touching anything, so
 *     ambiguity is detected rather than raced past.
 *   - No block-anchor tier (match on first/last line, guess the middle). That is the
 *     specific mechanism behind the corruption reports, and the cases it rescues are
 *     exactly the cases most likely to hit the wrong function.
 *
 * When a match can't be made unambiguously, the failure carries the actual candidate
 * LOCATIONS back to the model (see `describeMatches`), so its retry is informed rather
 * than another guess at the same string.
