/**
 * subagent.ts — spawn_subagent: delegate a bounded task to a scoped child agent.
 *
 * The context-isolation lever, orchestrator-worker style. A wide search or a
 * self-contained chunk of work can cost dozens of tool rounds whose intermediate
 * output would bloat the main agent's context. spawn_subagent runs that work in a
 * CHILD session — its own transcript, its own read ledger, its own step budget — and
 * returns only the child's final, distilled summary. The lead agent gets the answer
 * without the mess, and can spawn SEVERAL read-only workers in ONE message to fan out
 * in parallel (the engine runs concurrency-safe calls together).
 *
 * It reuses the engine's own `respond()` loop on a forked session (via `ctx.forkChild`,
 * injected by the engine), so a sub-agent is a full agent, not a lesser one. Recursion
 * is capped by `subagentDepth` so a sub-agent can't spawn its own sub-agents. The child
 * inherits the parent's approval channel and Sentinel gate, so its edits are gated too;
 * `read_only` restricts it to searching/reading for safe research tasks — and ONLY a
 * read-only worker is concurrency-safe (an editing worker runs alone, in order, so
 * parallel edits can't race). A process-wide semaphore bounds how many run at once.
