/**
 * cacheBreak.ts — noticing when the cached prefix stopped matching, and saying why (pure).
 *
 * Every provider caches the same way: it hashes the front of the request and reuses the
 * work if the next request starts with the same bytes. Change one character anywhere in
 * that region and the whole thing is re-read at full price. The region is large — the
 * system prompt plus every tool schema — so a break is one of the most expensive events
 * in a session, and it is completely invisible. Nothing fails. The reply is normal. The
 * only trace is on the bill.
 *
 * Two real ones shipped before this existed, and both were found by reading a session
 * file after the user had already paid: a skill catalog that varied with which files had
 * been read, and a tool search that added its result to the advertised list. Neither
 * announced itself, and neither was findable except in hindsight.
 *
 * So the prefix is hashed on the way out and compared with the last one. When it moves,
 * this says WHICH part moved — the model, the system prompt, a tool appearing or
 * disappearing, or one tool's schema changing under a stable name. That last case is the
 * one worth the per-tool hashes: a tool whose description is built from live state looks
 * identical by name and count while breaking the cache on every request.
 *
 * Provider-neutral by construction. It compares what WE send, so it needs no cache
 * reporting from anyone and works the same on a provider that documents nothing.
 *
 * A break is not automatically a bug — switching model or compacting invalidates the
 * prefix by design. The point is that it should be a decision someone made, not a
 * surprise, and an unexplained one is a defect that has already started costing money.
