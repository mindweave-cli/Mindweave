/**
 * cacheBreak.test.ts — the detector that would have caught the two expensive bugs.
 *
 * Both shipped, both were invisible, and both were found by reading a session file after
 * the fact: a skill catalog inside the system prompt that varied with which files had
 * been read, and a tool search that added what it found to the advertised list. Each test
 * below is one of those shapes, plus the ordering rule that makes a report actionable.
